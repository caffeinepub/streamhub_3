# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a streaming platform application with separate sections for movies and TV shows, each with browsing, detail, and playback functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Backend data models for movies, TV shows, and episodes with metadata (title, description, thumbnail, video URL, duration, genre, season/episode numbers)
- CRUD operations for movies, TV shows, and episodes
- Frontend home page with movie grid displaying thumbnails and metadata
- TV shows page with show grid and episode counts
- Movie detail page with full information and video player
- TV show detail page with episodes organized by season
- Episode player page with playback and navigation to next/previous episodes
- Navigation system with Movies and TV Shows sections
- Cinematic visual theme with rich colors, elegant typography, and sophisticated layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse movies and TV shows in grid layouts, view detailed information, and play video content through integrated players with episode navigation for TV shows.
